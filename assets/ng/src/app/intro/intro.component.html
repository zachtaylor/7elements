    You begin the game with a Deck of Cards. This is called your Future. You also begin with 7 Life.
    <br /><br />
    When a Players' Life reaches 0, that Player loses. When a Player has no more opponents, they win!
    <br /><br />
    Each turn, you will have several phases, and you can play cards. Keep reading to learn more.

    Your turn will have several Phases, outlined here.
    <br /><br />
    Each Phase requires a response from you. This is indicated by a timer ticking next to your name, as well as the
    "PASS" button. The "PASS" button will excuse you from the current Phase, typically failing any available choice.
    <br /><br />
    At all times, players may Trigger Powers of their Beings or Items, or Play Spell Cards

    Cards have a <i>cost</i> to play, and this is paid from your in-game Karma. You may only play Cards which you have
    enough Elements to use at the time.
    <br /><br />
    You won't be able to play certain cards when you don't have enough active Elements in your Karma to match the
    Elements listed on the title of each Card

  <article-header>Karma</article-header>
  <article-body>
    Each turn, your Karma will add a new Element color. Elements of your Karma will reactivate at the start of each turn
    <br /><br />
    All Cards have associated Element costs. These costs are paid from your active Karma
    <br /><br />
    Each turn, before you draw a card, choose any element to add to your available Karma, and it will be active in the
    same turn, onward
    <br /><br />
    Each card played deactivates elements of your Karma, but these elements become active again every turn, at Sunrise
    (start phase), on your turn

      These Cards add Beings to the Present, and the Card is also added to your Past. Beings may have abilities, or be
      used to Attack your opponent, reducing your opponents Health.
      <br /><br />
      Beings in the Present have active Health. When this reaches 0, the Being is removed from the Present. Beings do
      not (re-)gain Health unless otherwise specified. Beings Awaken at Sunrise (start phase) on your turn, and are
      Asleep when they enter the Present.
